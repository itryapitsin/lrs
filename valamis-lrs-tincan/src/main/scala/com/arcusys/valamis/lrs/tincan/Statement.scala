 * The Statement is the core of the xAPI.
 * All learning events are stored as Statements.
 * A Statement is akin to a sentence of the form "I did this".
 * @param id UUID assigned by LRS if not set by the Activity Provider.
 * @param actor Who the Statement is about, as an Agent or Group Object. Represents the "I" in "I Did This".
 * @param verb Action of the Learner or Team Object. Represents the "Did" in "I Did This".
 * @param obj Activity, Agent, or another Statement that is the Object of the Statement. Represents the "This" in "I Did This".
 * @param result Result Object, further details representing a measured outcome relevant to the specified Verb.
 * @param context Context that gives the Statement more meaning.
 * @param timestamp Timestamp of when the events described within this Statement occurred. If not provided, LRS should set this to the value of "stored" time.
 * @param stored Timestamp of when this Statement was recorded. Set by LRS.
 * @param authority Agent who is asserting this Statement is true. Verified by the LRS based on authentication, and set by LRS if left blank.
 * @param version The Statementâ€™s associated xAPI version
 * @param attachments Headers for attachments to the Statement
